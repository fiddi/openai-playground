"decentriq","How we Build Data Clean Rooms on Azure Confidential Computing at Decentriq","DAVID STURZENEGGER, PRIMO AMREIN","How we Build Data Clean Rooms on Azure Confidential Computing at Decentriq: This presentation will open with an overview of Microsoft’s confidential computing strategy and Azures Confidential Compute offering. Decentriq will then present their confidential computing-based data collaboration platform, a deeper dive into the technology as well as use-cases of their customers ranging from banks to pharmaceutical companies. In many cases it would be desirable to combine sensitive datasets from multiple sources to compute anonymous statistics. Examples range from healthcare research to customer analytics to anti-money laundering and marketing. However, the fact that data comes from multiple sources means that at least one party has to disclose sensitve data to another. In practice this usually means that such use-cases are blocked either for legal or lack-of-trust reasons. Confidential computing is a CPU-rooted privacy technology that enables the processing of data while keeping the data inaccessible to all parties - including all participants, the SaaS platform and infrastructure providers. Encryption in-use enables data to stay encrypted also in memory and prevent access by the operating system. Remote attestation enables users to remotely verify that a server indeed runs in confidential computing and even what code it is running."

"quantum","God really plays dice - Introduction to quantum computing with Q#","FILIP WOJCIESZYN","God really plays dice - Introduction to quantum computing with Q#: Quantum mechanics is one of the fundamental theories of physics, and has been tremendously successful at describing the behavior of subatomic particles. However, its counter-intuitive probabilistic nature, bizarre rules and confusing epistemology have troubled some of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, prompting Albert Einstein to remark “God doesn’t play dice”. Today, we are at the dawn of the quantum computing age, a multidisciplinary field that sits at the intersection of physics, computer science, mathematics and chemistry and may revolutionize the technological world. In this talk, we will dive into the bizarre quantum world and explore the high-level mathematical foundations of quantum computing, quantum programming circuits and some basic ideas behind it using a new quantum programming language, Q#."

"networkingvnext","Azure Networking vNext - How to build modern connectivity for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS","ERIC BERG","Azure Networking vNext - How to build modern connectivity for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS: When you are working with Microsoft Azure Services you will come across the topic of Network Integration. But is a classical VPN the right solution? Do I always need ExpressRoute? Should I adopt VirtualWAN? And what about my APIs in the Cloud? This session will help you to understand the available options to build modern Azure Networks. We will figure out how a solution-design could look like and which limitations apply. Also we will have a look into services that do not have options to integrate into a classical network and how you could mitigate this. Let’s figure out how to modernize networking in Azure!"
"sustainability","How can Microsoft Azure help with sustainability? Methods to estimate your cloud’s carbon footprint","WIBKE SUDHOLT","How can Microsoft Azure help with sustainability? Methods to estimate your cloud’s carbon footprint: Climate change and the looming energy crisis increasingly also have an impact on IT. Apart from moral responsibility there are serious commercial forces connected to this, including rising costs and risks of business interruption as well as influences on corporate image and government regulations. Cloud computing is debated to be both a problem as well as an answer here. Therefore, it is important to consider the sustainability of Microsoft Azure. Microsoft provides several tools to evaluate and drive sustainability aspects such as energy consumption and carbon footprint. This goes from a simple website to estimate the emission savings for Microsoft Cloud over the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft Azure in Power BI up to the Microsoft Sustainability Manager, an elaborated solution to record, report and reduce your environmental impact. Furthermore, there are external solutions such as the free and open source tool Cloud Carbon Footprint, which allows to estimate the energy consumption and carbon emissions of cloud usage across several hyperscalers. This talk starts with a summary about what is publicly known regarding the sustainability of the Microsoft Azure cloud in general. We then look at the different tools that are available to estimate important metrics such as carbon emissions and what their capabilities and use cases are. I’ll also show limits, in particular the complexity to calculate sustainability indicators for on-premises data centers in comparison to cloud. Goal is to give you an overview at hand helping you to judge how well the Microsoft Azure cloud supports you on your way to a more sustainable future."
